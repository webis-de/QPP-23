## Abstract
Searchers who can't satisfy their known-item information need using a search engine might ask their information need on question-answering platforms, hoping that the active discussion with other users solves the known-item question. Given that much effort can go into those discussions, effective query performance prediction might guide searchers in formulating good questions or not posting hopeless questions. To foster future research on novel applications of query performance prediction, especially in the light of the upcoming tip-of-the-tongue known-item retrieval track at TREC, we build a large-scale dataset for known-item question performance prediction containing 1.3 million known-item questions, of which 47 % are marked as solved. We use the time it took to solve a question (or the absence of a solution) as the performance of the question to evaluate the effectiveness of 7 standard pre-retrieval query performance predictors: all of them cannot predict the performance of known-item questions.
